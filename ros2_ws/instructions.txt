I tried to do this with a bash script, but it failed, so here we are. 

Run 
rm -rf build install log
this gets rid of the stuff old. 

colcon build
it will give you some errors about stuff that dosen't matter. it should run for about 12 seconds and say 1 package finished. 

Run
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

both of these tell ROS where to look. basically.

Run
install/movement/bin/mecanum_node

This actually starts the node.
